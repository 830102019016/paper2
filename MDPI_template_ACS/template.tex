\section{Introduction}

The sixth generation (6G) network has already been commenced as a new research initiative, following on from the evolving 5G network.This new type of network envisions sophisticated device-to-device (D2D) and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications,innovative artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, Internet of Everything (IoE) applications connecting people, data, things through processes.Interoperability and convergence between terrestrial and satellite infrastructures will be a prerequisite in the 6G networking. Also, the new space era of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) comprising of aerial networks, low Earth orbit (LEO) and especially very low Earth orbit (VLEO) satellites has emerged, enabling the path to 6G evolution.

Hybrid satellite-terrestrial networks (HSTNs) have been proposed as an efficient approach towards improving spectral efficiency and increasing the users’ reliability all over the world.The available spectrum resources of these networks can be further exploited by adopting the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) principle.However, in the absence of line-of-sight (LoS) conditions, the performance of satellite communication systems is severely deteriorating.

In the context of HSTNs, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based communications are expected to improve the performance in various ways.In general, the UAV-aided NOMA  schemes have gained the interest of the academia and the industry for various applications in the beyond 5G networks.Focusing on the scenario where the UAVs are adopted in satellite terrestrial communication networks, they could be employed in the NOMA scheme as an intermediate node for increasing the possibility of obtaining LoS conditions.

All-in-all, and to the best of our knowledge, no studies can be found related to the intelligent integration of aerial and satellite segments in 6G networks by utilizing a hybrid NOMA and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) transmission schemes. Motivated by this observation, in this paper, we propose a novel satellite aerial terrestrial cooperative network scheme, which will be termed SATCON. More specifically, SATCON is formed with the integration of aerial base station (ABS) in the existing satellite network by efficiently combining two unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely k-means and k-medoids. Furthermore, the proposed system promotes efficient cooperation between ABS and satellite through an innovative hybrid NOMA/OMA approach, avoiding the waste of resources and energy.Compared to standalone satellite NOMA transmission with optimal user pairing, namely SAT-NOMA, SATCON increases the sum rate and, at the same time, provides higher spectral efficiency for varying satellite channel conditions and ABS bandwidth.

\section{Materials and Methods}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:system_model}, the considered SAGIN consists of $\mathbf{U}$ UAVs denoted by $\mathcal{U} = {1, 2, \dots, U}$ and $\mathbf{S}$ LEO satellites indicated by $\mathcal{S} = {1, 2, \dots, S}$. In addition, $\mathbf{K}$ IoT devices randomly scattered on the ground are represented as $\mathcal{K} = {1, 2, \dots, K}$.

In the downlink, UEs may receive data either directly from the LEO satellite or through a UAV-assisted relaying link over the air-to-ground (A2G) channel. Satellite-side user pairing is first established based on direct downlink transmission, which serves as the reference for subsequent transmission decisions.Under this pairing, UAV-assisted transmission is activated only when it can provide a strict rate improvement over direct satellite delivery. Specifically, if both paired users achieve higher downlink rates via the UAV, UAV-assisted NOMA transmission is employed. If only one user benefits from UAV relaying, UAV-assisted OMA transmission is selectively applied to that user in order to avoid any performance degradation of the other. Otherwise, when UAV-assisted transmission cannot outperform direct satellite transmission for either user, both users are served directly by the satellite.

\label{fig:system_model}
\end{figure}

To characterize the downlink transmission options described above, the satellite downlink is modeled using a land mobile satellite(LMS)  channel. The overall channel coefficient between LEO satellite $s$ and UE $i$ is expressed as
\begin{equation}
h_i^s = \sqrt{L_i^s} \cdot g_i^s,
\end{equation}
where $L_i^s$ represents the large-scale free-space path loss given by
\begin{equation}
L_i^s = \left(\frac{c}{4\pi f_c d_i^s}\right)^2,
\end{equation}
with $f_c$ denoting the carrier frequency, $d_i^s$ the satellite-to-UE distance, and $c$ the speed of light.

The small-scale fading coefficient $g_i^s$ follows the Loo model,characterizing the composite fading as a superposition of a dominant line-of-sight (LoS) component and multipath fading
\begin{equation}
g_i^s(t) = A_i(t)e^{j\phi_i(t)} + m_i(t),
\end{equation}
where $A_i(t)$ represents the LoS amplitude with $20\log_{10}A_i(t) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$, and $m_i(t) = m_{I,i}(t) + jm_{Q,i}(t)$ denotes the multipath component with $m_{I,i}, m_{Q,i} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_m^2)$.The parameters are set as $\mu = -1$ dB, $\sigma = 2$ dB, corresponding to a suburban environment.

Furthermore, the Doppler effect induced by satellite motion is captured using the classical Jakes spectrum with maximum Doppler shift $f_D = v f_c / c$, where $v$ denotes the relative velocity between the satellite and UE.

For UAV-assisted transmission, data are forwarded to UEs through an air-to-ground (A2G) link. The channel coefficient between the UAV and UE $i$ is denoted by $h_i^d$ and can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
h_i^d = \sqrt{L_i^{\text{A2G}}} \cdot g_i^d,
\label{eq:channel coefficient}
\end{equation}
where $L_i^{\text{A2G}}$ represents the large-scale path loss and $g_i^d$ denotes the small-scale fading.

Following the elevation-angle-dependent model by Al-Hourani \emph{et al.}~\cite{al2014modeling}, the path loss accounts for probabilistic LoS and NLoS propagation in urban environments. The LoS probability is given by
\begin{equation}
P_{\text{LoS}}(\theta_i) = \frac{1}{1 + a \exp(-b[\theta_i - a])},
\end{equation}
where $\theta_i = \arcsin(H/\sqrt{H^2 + d_i^2})$ is the elevation angle, $H$ is the UAV altitude, $d_i$ is the horizontal distance, and $(a, b)$ are environment-dependent parameters. For urban environments, we adopt $a = 9.61$ and $b = 0.16$~\cite{al2014modeling}.

The composite path loss is then computed as
\begin{equation}
L_i^{\text{A2G}} = P_{\text{LoS}}(\theta_i) \cdot L_i^{\text{LoS}} 
+ [1-P_{\text{LoS}}(\theta_i)] \cdot L_i^{\text{NLoS}},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
L_i^{\text{LoS}}\text{(dB)} &= 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{4\pi f_c d_i^{\text{3D}}}{c}\right) + \eta_{\text{LoS}}, \\
L_i^{\text{NLoS}}\text{(dB)} &= 20\log_{10}\left(\frac{4\pi f_c d_i^{\text{3D}}}{c}\right) + \eta_{\text{NLoS}},
\label{eq:path loss}
\end{align}
with $d_i^{\text{3D}} = \sqrt{H^2 + d_i^2}$ denoting the 3D distance, and $\eta_{\text{LoS}} = 1$ dB, $\eta_{\text{NLoS}} = 20$ dB representing the excessive path loss for LoS and NLoS links, respectively~\cite{al2014modeling}.

It should be emphasized that the downlink rate delivered to a UE via UAV-assisted relaying is jointly determined by the A2G access link and the satellite-to-UAV (S2A) backhaul. Since the UAV can only forward the data it receives from the satellite, the capacity of the S2A backhaul may limit the effective downlink rate, preventing UAV-assisted transmission from consistently outperforming direct satellite delivery.

All downlink links are assumed to be impaired by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). These channel characteristics explain why UAV-assisted relaying may provide significant rate gains for some users while offering no advantage for others, thereby motivating rate-based downlink transmission mode selection.

\subsection{ABS placement process}

The ABS placement is performed prior to the hybrid transmission decision, since the A2G channel characteristics—and consequently the achievable UAV-assisted rates—are fundamentally determined by the ABS position. Without an appropriately optimized ABS location, the hybrid NOMA/OMA decision would be restricted to a limited set of feasible transmission options, leading to suboptimal system performance.

To facilitate effective hybrid NOMA/OMA downlink decision-making, the ABS placement is designed as a performance-aware structural optimization step rather than an isolated objective. Specifically, the three-dimensional ABS position $\mathbf{p} = (x_1^{p}, y_1^{p}, z_1^{p})$ is optimized to enhance the quality of the air-to-ground (A2G) channels, which directly determine the achievable UAV-assisted transmission rates. By improving the overall A2G channel conditions through position optimization, the proposed placement strategy enlarges the set of users for which UAV-assisted transmission can provide rate advantages over direct satellite delivery, thereby enabling more effective hybrid NOMA/OMA transmission decisions in the subsequent stage.It is worth noting that the placement optimization does not determine the transmission mode itself, but rather provides a favorable channel structure upon which the subsequent rate-based hybrid decision operates.
Based on the above considerations, the ABS placement is formulated as a preliminary, performance-aware optimization step that aims to enhance the air-to-ground (A2G) channel conditions prior to the hybrid transmission decision. Specifically, the three-dimensional ABS position $\mathbf{p} \in W$ is determined by maximizing the aggregate A2G downlink rate experienced by terrestrial users, which is expressed as
\begin{equation}
\underset{\mathbf{p} \in W}{\arg\max} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{K}} R_i^d(\mathbf{p}),
\label{eq:abs_placement_obj}
\end{equation}
where $W$ denotes the feasible spatial region for ABS deployment, and $R_i^d(\mathbf{p})$ represents the achievable A2G downlink rate for $\mathrm{IoT}_i$ when the ABS is positioned at $\mathbf{p}$. Since the subsequent hybrid NOMA/OMA transmission decision involves discrete user pairing and mode selection, a continuous and differentiable surrogate is adopted during the placement phase. In particular, the OMA transmission rate is used as a proxy for the A2G channel quality, given by
\begin{equation}
R_i^d(\mathbf{p}) = B_d \log_2 \left( 1 + P_d \Gamma_i^d(\mathbf{p}) \right),
\label{eq:oma_surrogate}
\end{equation}
where $B_d$ denotes the allocated A2G bandwidth, $P_d$ is the transmission power of the ABS, and $\Gamma_i^d(\mathbf{p})$ is the channel gain experienced by $\mathrm{IoT}_i$, which explicitly depends on the ABS position $\mathbf{p}$. 
By optimizing \eqref{eq:abs_placement_obj} with respect to $\mathbf{p}$, the proposed placement strategy improves the overall A2G channel quality, thereby providing a favorable rate landscape for the subsequent hybrid NOMA/OMA downlink decision.

The channel gain $\Gamma_i^d(\mathbf{p})$ is determined by the A2G channel model, and depends explicitly on the ABS position $\mathbf{p}$ through the elevation-angle-dependent path loss and the associated line-of-sight probability. In particular, both the horizontal distance between the ABS and $\mathrm{IoT}_i$ and the ABS altitude jointly influence the large-scale attenuation, which in turn affects the achievable A2G downlink rate.


The ABS position is restricted by the physical service area and practical deployment constraints of the considered system. Specifically, the horizontal coordinates of the ABS are confined within the coverage region of radius $R_{\text{cov}}$, while the altitude is limited to a feasible range $[z_{\text{min}}, z_{\text{max}}]$ to ensure reliable communication performance and compliance with regulatory requirements. These constraints can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    -R_{\text{cov}} &\leq x_1^{p} \leq R_{\text{cov}}, \\
    -R_{\text{cov}} &\leq y_1^{p} \leq R_{\text{cov}}, \\
    z_{\text{min}} &\leq z_1^{p} \leq z_{\text{max}},
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:position_constraints}
\end{equation}
where $R_{\text{cov}}$ denotes the horizontal coverage radius of the service area, and $[z_{\text{min}}, z_{\text{max}}]$ represents the permissible altitude range for ABS deployment, typically set to $[50~\text{m}, 500~\text{m}]$.

The ABS placement problem in~\eqref{eq:abs_placement_obj} is solved using the Limited-memory Broyden--Fletcher--Goldfarb--Shanno with Box constraints (L-BFGS-B) algorithm, which is suitable for bound-constrained nonlinear optimization. 
Starting from an initial position $\mathbf{p}_0$ defined by the geometric centroid of the user distribution in the horizontal plane with a default altitude of $100~\text{m}$, the algorithm iteratively updates the ABS location based on gradient information until convergence. The convergence tolerance is set to $\epsilon = 10^{-6}$ on the objective function value, with a maximum iteration limit of $100$ to ensure computational efficiency.

During the placement phase, the OMA rate in~\eqref{eq:oma_surrogate} is adopted as a continuous and differentiable surrogate, since the hybrid NOMA/OMA transmission scheme involves discrete user pairing and successive interference cancellation (SIC) operations that are not suitable for gradient-based optimization. The use of the OMA rate allows the placement optimization to focus on improving the A2G channel conditions without imposing any transmission mode decisions.

The optimized ABS position obtained from this procedure is subsequently used as the deployment configuration for the hybrid NOMA/OMA downlink transmission.

\subsection{Satellite NOMA transmission}

For the satellite transmission, each $M T_l \ (1 \le l \le N)$ periodically reports the channel state information (CSI) of the LMS channel to the satellite that receives the complex channel coefficient $h_l^s$ and calculates the channel gain including additional gains, losses, and the noise power of the satellite receiver $N_s$ as
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{l}^{s}
= \frac{G_{t}^{s} G_{r}^{s}}{L_{l}^{\mathrm{FS}} N_{s}} \, |h_{l}^{s}|^{2}.
\end{equation}

The satellite aims to create $K$ pairs of MTs, where each pair will share the same sub-channel in the power and time domain, assigning different power allocation factors of the total satellite power $P_s$ to each MT belonging to a pair. Towards this end, a NOMA optimal user pairing policy is adopted, where the satellite sorts the MTs in ascending order by the channel gain $\Gamma_1^{s} \le \Gamma_2^{s} \le \cdots \le \Gamma_{2K}^{s}$ and matches the user $MT_k$ with the user $MT_{2K-k+1}$, for $1 \le k \le K$.Hence, each pair consists of the strong satellite channel user $MT_j^s$, and the weak satellite  channel user $MT_i^s$, with channel gains $\Gamma_j^{s} \ge \Gamma^{s}$,respectively.

The optimal power allocation factor $\beta_j^s$ can be calculated by the following expression
\begin{equation}
\beta_{j}^{s}
= \frac{\sqrt{1 + \Gamma_{i}^{s} P_{s}} - 1}{\Gamma_{i}^{s} P_{s}}.
\label{power allocation}
\end{equation}

According to the principle of NOMA, $MT_i^s$ will immediately decode its own signal by the received satellite signal, while $MT_j^s$ should first estimate the signal of the $MT_i^s$ and then perform successive interference cancellation (SIC) to retrieve its own signal.The achievable rates of $MT_j^s$ and $MT_i^s$ are
\begin{equation}
R_{j}^{s}
= \frac{B_{s}}{K} \log_{2}\!\left( 1 + \beta_{j}^{s} P_{s} \Gamma_{j}^{s} \right),
\label{achievable rates j}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
R_{i}^{s}
= \frac{B_{s}}{K} \log_{2}\!\left(
1 + \frac{(1 - \beta_{j}^{s}) P_{s} \Gamma_{i}^{s}}{\beta_{j}^{s} P_{s} \Gamma_{i}^{s} + 1}
\right).
\label{achievable rates i}

As described previously, ABS is integrated into the satellite network to improve the QoS of terrestrial users. Towards this end, the ABS should first receive and decode the NOMA superimposed signals of each pair of MTs via the S2A channel. The S2A channel gain can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\Lambda_{sd}
= \frac{G_{t}^{s} G_{r}^{sd}}{L_{sd}^{\mathrm{FS}} N_{sd}}.
\end{equation}
The maximum achievable decoding rates which succeed by the ABS through the S2A channel for each $MT_j^s$ and $MT_i^s$ in pair are
\begin{equation}
R_{j}^{sd}
= \frac{B_{s}}{K} \log_{2}\!\left( 1 + \beta_{j}^{s} P_{s} \Lambda_{sd} \right),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
R_{i}^{sd}
= \frac{B_{s}}{K} \log_{2}\!\left(
1 + \frac{(1 - \beta_{j}^{s}) P_{s} \Lambda_{sd}}
{\beta_{j}^{s} P_{s} \Lambda_{sd} + 1}
\right).
\end{equation}

Note that, the ABS obtains all the pair indices from the VLEO through a dedicated control channel to identify the users comprising each pair and their role, e.g., strong or weak satellite channel users. Also, the ABS acquires the achievable rate $R_l^s$ of each $MT_l$ with the satellite, through the same channel.

Next, the ABS should forward the decoded signals to the MTs through the A2G channel, utilizing the proposed hybrid NOMA/OMA transmission scheme. Consequently, we consider that each $MT_l$ reports the CSI of the corresponding A2G link to the ABS. Therefore, the ABS calculates the channel gain of the A2G link for each M Tl as follows
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{l}^{d}
= \frac{G_{t}^{d} G_{r}^{d}}{L_{l}^{\mathrm{A2G}}(h, r_{l}) \, N_{d}} \, |h_{l}^{d}|^{2}.
\end{equation}

Following the same NOMA user pairing policy as the VLEO, the ABS forms $K$ MT pairs, considering now the channel gains of the A2G links. Therefore, each pair consists of the strong A2G channel user $MT_j^d$, and the weak A2G channel user $MT_i^d$, where $\Gamma_{j}^{d} \ge \Gamma_{i}^{d}$. Subsequently, calculates the optimal power allocation factor $\beta_j^d$ for the $MT_j^d$ by replacing $s$ with $d$ in expression \ref{power allocation}.Also, the achievable rates in NOMA, $R_j^d$ and $MT_i^d$,are given by the expressions \ref{achievable rates j} and \ref{achievable rates i}, respectively, by replacing again $s$ with $d$.The rates that ABS can offer to $MT_j^d$ and $MT_i^d$, utilizing the NOMA technique, are $R_{j}^{dn} = \min\left( R_{j}^{d},\, R_{j}^{sd} \right)$ and $R_{i}^{dn} = \min\left( R_{i}^{d},\, R_{i}^{sd} \right)$,respectively.

Lastly, the ABS has to decide whether it is profitable for each pair of MTs to transmit the superimposed signal or to transmit only the signal of one MT of each pair utilizing the OMA technique. Also, the ABS can avoid forwarding the satellite signals if the ABS transmission is not profitable for both MTs in pair. Therefore, the achievable rate that each $MT_l$ can achieve from the ABS through OMA, is equal to
\begin{equation}
R_{l}^{o}
= \frac{B_{d}}{K} \log_{2}\!\left( 1 + P_{d} \Gamma_{l}^{d} \right).
\end{equation}
Each $MT_l$ will experience higher rates if the ABS uses OMA, i.e., $R_{l}^{o} \ge R_{l}^{d}$, since the same bandwidth as NOMA is allocated for OMA transmission, and whole $P_d$ is allocated to $MT_l$. However, the maximum achievable OMA rate of $MT_l$ is restricted by the expression $R_{l}^{do} = \min\left( R_{l}^{o},\, R_{l}^{sd} \right)$,since the ABS may provide a higher rate to the $MT_l$,but the rate at which ABS decoded its signal from the VLEO is lower and vice versa. There are four different cases that the ABS considers for each MT pair
\begin{itemize}
\item	$\bf{if}$ $R_{i}^{s} < R^{dn}_i$ $\bf{and}$ $R_{j}^{s} < R_{j}^{dn}$: In this case, the pair of MTs formed by the ABS profits from the NOMA transmission as both MTs achieve greater rates if served from the ABS instead of the satellite.
\item	$\bf{if}$ $R_{i}^{s} < R^{dn}_i$ $\bf{and}$ $R_{j}^{s} \ge R_{j}^{dn}$: In this case, only $MT_i^d$ profits from the ABS transmission. Thus, the ABS  utilizes OMA and transmits only to $MT_i^d$ or the timeslot allocated to this pair. $MT_i^d$ achieves a rate equal to $R_i^{do}$.
\item	$\bf{if}$ $R_{i}^{s} \ge R^{dn}_i$ $\bf{and}$ $R_{j}^{s} < R_{j}^{dn}$: In this case, only $MT_j^d$ profits from the ABS transmission. Therefore, the ABS utilizes OMA and transmits only to $MT_j^d$ for the timeslot allocated to this pair. $MT_j^d$ achieves a rate equal to $R_i^{do}$.
\item  Otherwise, the communication for this MT pair is not profitable and ABS does not transmit to these pair of users in order to save resources.
\end{itemize}
