# Clarification Checklist for Joint Transmission Decision Framework

This document lists the key questions that need clarification to accurately
formalize and describe the proposed joint transmission decision framework
in Section 3 and ensure a consistent system-level narrative throughout the paper.

---

## 1. System-Level Decision Scope

1.1 Is the transmission decision made:
- per UE, or
- per UE pair (NOMA pair), or
- jointly across all UE pairs?

1.2 Once a transmission option is selected for a UE (or UE pair),
is the decision fixed within one realization, or can it change
across iterations of the joint optimization framework?

---

## 2. Transmission Options Considered in Section 3

2.1 Please confirm the complete set of transmission options that a UE (or UE pair) can choose from:
- Direct satellite transmission
- ABS-assisted NOMA
- ABS-assisted OMA
- Other (if any)

2.2 In ABS-assisted modes, is the satellite-to-ABS (S2A) backhaul
always required, or are there cases where ABS operates independently
of the satellite?

---

## 3. Rate Coupling and Bottlenecks

3.1 For ABS-assisted transmission, is the achievable rate determined by:
- the minimum of S2A and A2G rates, or
- another coupling rule?

3.2 Is the S2A backhaul shared among multiple UE pairs,
and does this introduce inter-pair coupling or capacity constraints?

---

## 4. ABS Placement and Feedback Coupling

4.1 After a transmission decision is made, does it explicitly
feed back into the ABS placement optimization?

4.2 If yes, which quantities are fed back:
- selected transmission modes,
- achieved rates,
- active UE set served by ABS,
- or other metrics?

---

## 5. Nature of the Joint Optimization Framework

5.1 Is the overall framework best described as:
- alternating optimization,
- block coordinate descent,
- heuristic iterative refinement,
- or another paradigm?

5.2 Is convergence guaranteed, empirically observed, or not explicitly claimed?

---

## 6. Decision Solving Strategy

6.1 Is the joint transmission decision formulated as:
- an explicit optimization problem (e.g., integer programming), or
- a rule-based / greedy decision mechanism?

6.2 If heuristics are used, should the paper emphasize:
- low complexity,
- scalability,
- or near-optimal performance?

---

## 7. Baseline vs. Proposed System Boundary

7.1 Which components are strictly baseline and NOT part of the proposed contribution?
(e.g., Satellite NOMA, ABS-assisted NOMA/OMA transmission models)

7.2 Which components should be emphasized as NEW in Section 3?
(e.g., joint decision logic, feedback loop, system-level objective)

---

## 8. Algorithm Representation Preference

8.1 Do you prefer the joint framework to be presented primarily as:
- mathematical formulation,
- algorithm pseudocode,
- flowchart-level description,
- or a combination?

8.2 Should low-level implementation details (e.g., rate computation steps)
be placed in the main text or moved to an appendix?

---

## 9. Evaluation Alignment

9.1 In simulations, which performance gain is MOST critical to highlight:
- sum rate improvement,
- percentage of users benefiting from ABS assistance,
- robustness to satellite link degradation,
- or convergence behavior?

9.2 Are there scenarios where the proposed system deliberately falls back
to pure satellite transmission, and should this be emphasized as a feature?

---

## 10. Authorial Positioning (Very Important)

10.1 Should Section 3 be written with emphasis on:
- theoretical optimality, or
- practical system design and engineering insight?

10.2 Are you aiming for the contribution to be perceived primarily as:
- a new optimization algorithm,
- a new system framework,
- or a new performance-driven design philosophy?
